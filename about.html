		<p class="text left">
			"We are who we are because you make us", standing on the shoulders of each other so that we can reach where others cannot.
			For almost all of conscious civilization, humanity has sought to consolidate for survival- perhaps even more necessary for its seemingly self-aware, <em>Smart</em> cohort.
			So, in the face of this irony, we're here together: to gather, to conceive, and to create. <br> <br>
			We're unashamedly primal in our pledge to altruism; we're the obnoxious blotch in the face of society's linen: <a class="text-fill">We're MandelBrot.</a>
			We are part of this group to learn and to teach each other. We accept that research is challenging and requires perseverance
			and that success as well as failure leads to new knowledge. We understand that we must be open to new ideas and accept constructive feedback
			to support our growth. <br><br>
			We weclome diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives and interact inclusively. Doing so enriches our experiences, cultivates
			and advances science and technology. <br> <br>
			As motivated as we are, we deisre to make this world a little bit better at time. We are a community, so when you join us,
			you enjoy the benefits of being able to contribute, have fun, and have your work being recognized by the community and the whole world at large.
